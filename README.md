## Developing

#### Branches
- master: the current version(stable) running on the server
- develop: the main trunk of the whole project(ahead to master)
- release: a 'temp' branch emerge when we need to 'cut' and 'deploy' a new version. Merge to the master in the end, not to the develop.
- [feature]: a 'temp' branch emerge during development. Merge to the develop in the end, not to the master.
- [dev_pres_]: was reserved branch to preserve some achivement at a stage.

2. Cut and modify for conflict.
3. Upload seeds if any
4. set 'export NODE_ENV=production'
5. db: migrate if needed
7. run build:server.
6. run build.
7. run start.
